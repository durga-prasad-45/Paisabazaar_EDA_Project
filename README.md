 Banking Fraud Detection Analysis – EDA Project
 
This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a banking dataset to identify patterns, trends, and potential indicators of fraudulent activities. The analysis helps understand customer behavior, transaction characteristics, and risk factors associated with fraud detection.

Objective

The main goals of this project are:
Understand the structure and quality of the dataset
Identify missing values and duplicates
Explore relationships between variables
Detect patterns that may indicate fraudulent transactions
Generate insights using data visualization
Dataset Description

The dataset contains banking and customer transaction details such as:

Customer information
Transaction details
Loan and credit features
Fraud indicators
Financial behavior patterns

Tools & Technologies Used

Python
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas – Data manipulation
NumPy – Numerical operations
Matplotlib – Data visualization
Seaborn – Advanced visualizations

Steps Performed in Analysis :

1️ Data Loading
Imported dataset into Jupyter Notebook
Checked rows and columns count

2️ Data Understanding
Explored dataset structure
Viewed data types and summary

3️ Data Cleaning
Checked for duplicate values
Identified missing/null values

4️ Exploratory Data Analysis
Analyzed key variables
Studied relationships between features
Visualized trends and distributions

5️ Insights Generation
Identified risk patterns in transactions
Observed customer behavior trends
Highlighted potential fraud indicators

Key Insights

Certain transaction patterns show higher fraud risk
Missing values were handled before analysis
Some features strongly correlate with fraudulent behavior
Data visualization helped uncover hidden patterns
